# Portfolio-Projects

This is a repository created for my personal projects on datasets that I find interesting.
I run data exploration, data analysis and then bring them into Tableau for visualization.

"Coffee in Yelp" is a Jupyter notebook exploring coffee businesses in the open Yelp Academic dataset.
You can find example Python scripts and ad hoc SQL queries I've written here.

The "COVID" and "Nashville Housing" files showcase more examples of SQL queries I've written.
